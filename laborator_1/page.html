                One of <b>six predetermined origin stories</b> begins the game, depending on the player character's <u>race</u> and
                <u>class</u>. Each story ends with the player leaving with Duncan, the commander of Ferelden's Grey Wardens
                who, seeking new recruits, selects the player as a potential candidate. Duncan initiates the player into the
                Grey Wardens via a dangerous ritual called the Joining, which involves imbibing Darkspawn blood.

                In 9:41 the mage-templar war is temporarily halted during the Conclave, a peace conference orchestrated by
                Divine Justinia. During the negotiations, an explosion destroys the Conclave. This kills the Divine and many
                senior Chantry clerics along with many mages and templars, and creates a massive hole in the Veil.
                The only survivor is the <b>player character</b>, but retains no memory of what happened.
